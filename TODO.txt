SRU 2.0: Now with less speculation!
TODO LIST today:


TODO LIST for alpha:
graph generation
export speed enhancements + Ryan magic

TODO LIST for beta:
Coordinate helpers
pdf file to doc conversion
dctmk integration
better error checking and handling with asserts
global configs to disable stuff
sru::util::cmd stderr checking
append instead of insert 999
optional json?
active resting average got weird sticky sometimes
plural forms


TODO LIST for stable:
good logging system
gather more data about page like size
fix or make limitation clear that capital U and W (only in text type = 1) cant be displayed for some reason
verify and compare results against v1 to make sure all edge cases are handled properly (also check source code of v1)

TODO LIST for later:
more fine grained control for page detection
libqpdf integration, dctmk integration
Page overflow
opensourcing
CTRE JIT :^)
sticky linking
add transform support to objects


table creation:
configurable x axis and y axis (Time in our case) where the x axis defines the amount of values used (in our case should always match or be larger then the gather values)
create special collumn object with name and vector of values (ints in our case but store in float), for dates we have to calculate the delta,
 to generate the graph we need to get the starting data from somewhere (perhaps save the first time entry).

graph generation:
for now just inject the graph and hard code most values and follow original design except data gathering.
