SRU 2.0: Now with less speculation!
TODO LIST today:

TODO LIST for beta:
Coordinate helpers
pdf file to doc conversion
better error checking and handling with asserts
global configs to disable stuff
sru::util::cmd stderr checking
active resting average got weird sticky sometimes
plural forms


TODO LIST for stable:
graph generation
good logging system
gather more data about page like size
verify and compare results against v1 to make sure all edge cases are handled properly (also check source code of v1)

TODO LIST for later:
more fine grained control for page detection
libqpdf integration, dctmk integration
Page overflow
opensourcing
CTRE JIT :^)
sticky linking
add transform support to objects

graph generation:
for now just inject the graph and hard code most values and follow original design except data gathering.
