SRU 2.0: Now with less speculation!
TODO LIST today:
re-add new stickies when writing to final pdf
implement AVRG with recursive call
add some more test configs

TODO LIST for alpha:
graph generation
final pdf building
userinput in calculations
quick export
ability to construct stickies
setMarked() or setStickied() or setAnchor()
reminder: end: has to be sorted based on all time values

TODO LIST for beta:
Coordinate helpers
pdf file to doc convertion
dctmk integration
better error checking and handling with asserts
Ryan magic
global configs to disable stuff
sru::util::cmd stderr checking
regex match marked objects as well
maybe phase out internal sticky and let the user handle it
append instead of insert 999

TODO LIST for stable:
good logging system
gather more data about page like size
fix or make limitation clear that capital U and W (only in text type = 1) cant be displayed for some reason
verify and compare results against v1 to make sure all edge cases are handled properly (also check source code of v1)

TODO LIST for later:
more fine grained control for page detection
libqpdf integration, dctmk integration
Page overflow
opensourcing
CTRE JIT :^)
sticky linking
add transform support to objects


Ideas:
Page range configs + virtual anchors = profit!



Graph stuff:
Create option for margin_x/y to be based on an anchor (for our case its Total: and Result:)
Add option to have virtual x/y assist in searching (in case of dupes) since order cant be trusted OR or use id as order

table creation:
configurable x axis and y axis (Time in our case) where the x axis defines the amount of values used (in our case should always match or be larger then the gather values)
create special collumn object with name and vector of values (ints in our case but store in float), for dates we have to calculate the delta,
 to generate the graph we need to get the starting data from somewhere (perhaps save the first time entry).

graph generation:



Sticky stuff:
create a function to get stickies for a certain object (ugly back search sadly)
or
give objects recursive ability to house their own sticky

goal here is to keep integrity between export and import for reasons :)


JSON REDO:
disallow mixing certain modes e.g. sort

in software check for array lengths
