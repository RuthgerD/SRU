SRU 2.0: Now with less speculation!
TODO LIST today:
instead of copy_to_final have more generalized copy / delete / optional
Coordinate helpers
object writing

TODO LIST for alpha:
instead of copy_to_final have more generalized copy / delete / optional
actual object write system
graph generation
numbering support in calculations
userinput in calculations
pdf sorting based on a special object config key (user configurable)

TODO LIST for beta:
pdf file to doc convertion
config defaulting to reduce config size
dctmk integration
better error checking and handling with asserts
Ryan magic
global configs to disable stuff
good logging system
sru::util::cmd stderr checking

TODO LIST for stable:
verify and compare results against v1 to make sure all edge cases are handled properly (also check source code of v1)

TODO LIST for later:
more fine grained control for page detection
libqpdf integration, dctmk integration
Page overflow
opensourcing
CTRE JIT :^)


Ideas:
Page range configs + virtual anchors = profit!



Graph stuff:
Create option for margin_x/y to be based on an anchor (for our case its Total: and Result:)
Add option to have virtual x/y assist in searching (in case of dupes) since order cant be trusted OR or use id as order

table creation:
configurable x axis and y axis (Time in our case) where the x axis defines the amount of values used (in our case should always match or be larger then the gather values)
create special collumn object with name and vector of values (ints in our case but store in float), for dates we have to calculate the delta,
 to generate the graph we need to get the starting data from somewhere (perhaps save the first time entry).

graph generation:
